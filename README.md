# Outcomes: 

- Used non-linear units like ReLU to improve network model.
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer).
- Implemented an easy-to-use neural network class.

# Image Classifier Outcomes: 
- Build and applied a deep neural network to supervised learning (for image classification).
- The model showed an improvement of classification to 74% (it was a 4 layer model) as compared to logistic regression of 72%.
